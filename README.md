## Build

This project utilizes CMake presets but can also be built using plain old CMake. The Debug preset is the preferred preset to work with during development. The plugins are built using the [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) framework that is fetched during cmake configure step with the help of the [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) module in CMake.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erikgrahn13/audio.git
cd audio
cmake --preset Debug
cmake --build build <plugin>
```

If using VSCode it is recommended to use the [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) extension for managing the development.

The building of the plugins also builds the AudioPluginHost provided by JUCE so the plugins can be loaded in to a host. The mechanism for setting that up is already provided as debug configurations in launch.json.
